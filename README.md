Usage:  
This project is a webpage that shows emote streaks on the bottom left of the page. (Page dimensions are 1280px x 720px)  
It can also show emotes randomly on screen if a chatter does !showemote (emote_name)  
*This overlay can be used in streaming software like OBS*  
  
This project took direct inspiration from pajlada's pajbot, although I believe my version is easier to setup and use.
